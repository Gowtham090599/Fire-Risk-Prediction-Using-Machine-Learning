# Fire-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

#### Project Status: Active
#### Current Model's Average F1 Score: 0.67

## Project Intro/Objective
This project attempts to model and acquire data from SF OpenData - and other sources - to predict the relative risk of fire in San Franciscoâ€™s buildings and public spaces.

### Methods Used
* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
  * NumPy / pandas
  * Scikit-learn
  * matplotlib
* R
  * dplyr / tidyr
  * ggplot2
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
The mapping software will allow the user to type in an address and see fire-related risks and incidences around their area, as well as provide recommendations by fire safety experts in cases where there may be a high enough score to warrant preventive actions.
This project is modeled after Data Science for Social Good's (DSSG) Firebird Project in Atlanta, GA. Consultation is occasionally provided by members of the DSSG and former members of the Atlanta project.

## Needs of this project
1) data scientists
2) data analysts
3) data visualizers
4) researchers and journalists (find trends and data related to fire incidents in the city)
5) product and project managers

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo. For help, see [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Download data stored in the [project Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7ce50Tgcva8T2JNdTlxdi1hRXc).
3. Review [Project Wiki](https://github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-firerisk/wiki).
4. Check [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-firerisk/issues) and discuss with team members to understand current project needs.
5. Hack away! :)
